  <strong>What:</strong>
  Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose members teach basic software 
  skills to researchers in science, engineering, and medicine. Researchers often spend 
  much of their time wrestling with software, but most are self-taught programmers. 
  As a result, they spend hours doing things that should take minutes, reinvent a 
  lot of wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable. To tackle 
  this problem, Software Carpentry run bootcamps at dozens of sites around 
  the world, ranging from ultra-prestigious institutions like Harvard and Oxford to 
  far-flung universities in places like Beirut, Cape Town and now Melbourne!
