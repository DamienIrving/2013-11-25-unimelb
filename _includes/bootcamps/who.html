  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The bootcamp is aimed at postgraduate students, post-docs and other 
  research staff at the University of Melbourne who are familiar with 
  basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions, 
  but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help 
  them work more productively.
